# Lesson 3: Conditionals

This lesson focuses on Python conditionals, which allow you to control the program flow based on conditions. By completing these exercises, you'll gain hands-on experience with decision-making structures, logical operators, and debugging techniques for conditional logic.

---

## Lesson Objectives
- Master the use of `if`, `if-else`, and `if-elif-else` statements.
- Create nested and hierarchical conditionals for complex scenarios.
- Combine conditions using logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`).
- Refine code by debugging and improving conditional logic.
- Explore advanced conditionals, including membership testing and ternary operators.

---

## Exercises
In this lesson, you will work through 10 TODOs to strengthen your understanding of conditionals:
1. Write a basic `if` statement to handle a single condition.
2. Use `if-else` for binary decision-making scenarios.
3. Create an `if-elif-else` ladder for multi-condition checks.
4. Use logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) to evaluate multiple conditions.
5. Implement nested `if` statements to handle hierarchical logic.
6. Apply ternary operators to simplify conditionals into concise one-liners.
7. Write complex conditionals involving multiple checks and conditions.
8. Test membership in lists using `in` and `not in`.
9. Write user-interactive conditionals that process dynamic input.
10. Debug faulty conditional logic and refine the program for correctness.

## Practical Examples
Here are additional real-world examples to enhance your understanding:

1. **Eligibility Checker**  
   - Write a program to check if someone is eligible to drive.  
   - Ask for the user's age.  
   - If the age is 18 or older, print: `"You are eligible to drive."`  
   - Otherwise, print: `"You are not eligible to drive."`

2. **Discount Calculator**  
   - Write a program that calculates the discount based on the purchase amount.  
   - If the amount is greater than $100, apply a 10% discount.  
   - Otherwise, apply a 5% discount.  
   - Print the final price.

3. **Temperature Warning**  
   - Write a program to classify the weather based on the temperature.  
   - Ask the user to enter the temperature.  
   - If the temperature is greater than 30, print: `"Hot"`.  
   - If the temperature is between 15 and 30, print: `"Warm"`.  
   - Otherwise, print: `"Cold"`.

4. **Tax Bracket Calculator**  
   - Write a program to determine the tax rate based on income:  
     - Income < $10,000: No tax.  
     - Income $10,000â€“$50,000: 10% tax.  
     - Income > $50,000: 20% tax.  
   - Print the applicable tax rate.

5. **Rock-Paper-Scissors Game**  
   - Write a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game:  
     - Ask the user to choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors.  
     - Randomly generate the computer's choice.  
     - Determine the winner based on the rules:  
       - Rock beats Scissors.  
       - Scissors beats Paper.  
       - Paper beats Rock.
