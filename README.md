# Lesson 3: Conditionals

This lesson introduces Python conditionals, allowing you to control program flow based on conditions. By completing the exercises, youâ€™ll gain hands-on experience with decision-making structures.

## Objectives:
- Use `if`, `if-else`, and `if-elif-else` statements effectively.
- Write nested and complex conditionals.
- Apply logical operators in conditionals.
- Debug and refine conditional logic.

## TODOs:
1. Write basic `if` statements for simple conditions.
2. Use `if-else` for binary decisions.
3. Create `if-elif-else` ladders for multi-condition checks.
4. Implement logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) in conditions.
5. Use nested `if` statements for hierarchical checks.
6. Apply ternary operators for concise conditionals.
7. Write complex conditionals for multiple checks.
8. Test membership in lists using `in` and `not in`.
9. Implement conditionals with user input.
10. Debug faulty conditional logic.

## How to Complete the Lesson:
1. Open `lesson_03.py` and complete the TODOs.
2. Run the script to test your logic.

## How to Test Your Code:
Run the test script to verify your solutions:

```bash
python3 test_lesson_03.py
